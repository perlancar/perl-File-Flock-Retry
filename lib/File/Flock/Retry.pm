#ABSTRACT: Yet another flock module

=for Pod::Coverage ^(DESTROY)$

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use File::Flock::Retry;

 # try to acquire exclusive lock. if fail to acquire lock within 60s, die.
 my $lock = File::Flock::Retry->lock($file);

 # explicitly unlock
 $lock->release;

 # automatically unlock if object is DESTROY-ed.
 undef $lock;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is yet another flock module. It is a more lightweight alternative to
L<File::Flock> with some other differences:

=over 4

=item * OO interface only

=item * Autoretry (by default for 60s) when trying to acquire lock

I prefer this approach to blocking/waiting indefinitely or failing immediately.

=back


=head1 METHODS

=head2 $lock = File::Flock::Retry->lock($path, \%opts)

Attempt to acquire an exclusive lock on C<$path>. C<$path> will be created if
not already exists. If $path is already locked by another process, will retry
every second for a number of seconds (by default 60). Will die if failed to
acquire lock after all retries.

Will automatically unlock if C<$lock> goes out of scope. Upon unlock, will
remove C<$path> if it was created and is still empty (this behavior is the same
as C<File::Flock>).

Available options:

=over

=item * retries => int (default: 60)

Number of retries (equals number of seconds, since retry is done every second).

=item * shared => bool (default: 0)

By default, an exclusive lock (LOCK_EX) is attempted. However, if this option is
set to true, a shared lock (LOCK_SH) is attempted.

=back

=head2 $lock->unlock

Unlock.

=head2 $lock->release

Synonym for C<unlock()>.


=head1 CAVEATS

Not yet tested on Windows. Some filesystems do not support inode?


=head1 SEE ALSO

L<File::Flock>

L<File::Flock::Tiny> which is also tiny, but does not have the autoremove and
autoretry capability which I want. See also:
